# 67. Add Binary
Given two binary strings  `a`  and  `b`, return  _their sum as a binary string_.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
```
**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104`
-   `a`  and  `b`  consist only of  `'0'`  or  `'1'`  characters.
-   Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.

**My Solution:**
```python=
class Solution:
    def addBinary(self, a: str, b: str) -> str:
        a1 = str(int(a, 2))
        b1 = str(int(b, 2))
        c = int(a1) + int(b1)
        d = str(format(c, "b"))
        return d
