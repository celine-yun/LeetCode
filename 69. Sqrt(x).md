# 69. Sqrt(x)

Given a non-negative integer  `x`, compute and return  _the square root of_  `x`.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are  **truncated**, and only  **the integer part**  of the result is returned.

**Note:** You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operator, such as  `pow(x, 0.5)`  or `x ** 0.5`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```
**Constraints:**

-   `0 <= x <= 231  - 1`

**My Solution:**
```python=
import math
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        return math.trunc(math.sqrt(x))        
```
