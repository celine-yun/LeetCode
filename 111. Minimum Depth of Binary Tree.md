# 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5
```
**Constraints:**

-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range  `[0, 105]`.
-   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

**My Solution:**
```python=
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def mD(temp):
            if not temp:
                return 0
            if not temp.left:
                return mD(temp.right) + 1
            if not temp.right:
                return mD(temp.left) + 1
            return min(mD(temp.left), mD(temp.right)) + 1
        return mD(root)
```
