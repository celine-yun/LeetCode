# 14. Longest Common Prefix
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string  `""`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
```
**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
-   `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
-   `strs[i]`  consists of only lower-case English letters.

**My Solution:**
```python=
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        r = min(strs, key=len)
        s = ""
        for i in range(len(r)):
            n = strs[0][i]
            for j in range(len(strs)):
                if strs[j][i] != n:
                    return s
            s += n
        return s
