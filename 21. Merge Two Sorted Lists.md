# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a  **sorted**  list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/merge_ex1.jpg)
```
Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
Output: []
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```
**Constraints:**

-   The number of nodes in both lists is in the range  `[0, 50]`.
-   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
-   Both  `l1`  and  `l2`  are sorted in  **non-decreasing**  order.

**My Solution:**
```python=
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        dummyNode = ListNode(0)
        temp = dummyNode
        while l1 and l2:
            if l1.val <= l2.val:
                temp.next = l1
                l1 = l1.next
            else:
                temp.next = l2
                l2 = l2.next
            temp = temp.next
        if l1 == None:
            temp.next = l2
        elif l2 == None:
            temp.next = l1
        return  dummyNode.next
```
