# 58. Length of Last Word

Given a string  `s`  consists of some words separated by spaces, return  _the length of the last word in the string. If the last word does not exist, return_ `0`.

A  **word**  is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = " "
Output: 0
```
**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 104`
-   `s`  consists of only English letters and spaces  `' '`.

**My Solution:**
```python=
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        w = s.split()
        if w:
            return len(w[-1])
        return 0
```
