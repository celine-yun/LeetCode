# 101. Symmetric Tree
Given the  `root`  of a binary tree,  _check whether it is a mirror of itself_  (i.e., symmetric around its center).

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/symtree1.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
```
**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/symtree2.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
```
**Constraints:**

-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range  `[1, 1000]`.
-   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

**My Solution:**
```python=
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        def iS(p, q):
            if not p and not q:
                return True
            elif not p and q:
                return False
            elif not q and p:
                return False
            elif p.val != q.val:
                return False
            return iS(p.left, q.right) and iS(p.right, q.left)
        return iS(root.left, root.right)
