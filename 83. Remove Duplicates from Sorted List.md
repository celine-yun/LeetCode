# 83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List
Given the  `head`  of a sorted linked list,  _delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once_. Return  _the linked list  **sorted**  as well_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/list1.jpg)
```
**Input:** head = [1,1,2]
**Output:** [1,2]
```
**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/list2.jpg)
```
**Input:** head = [1,1,2,3,3]
**Output:** [1,2,3]
```
**Constraints:**

-   The number of nodes in the list is in the range  `[0, 300]`.
-   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
-   The list is guaranteed to be  **sorted**  in ascending order.

**My Solution:**
```python=
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        temp = head
        while temp and temp.next:
            if temp.next.val == temp.val:
                temp.next = temp.next.next
                continue
            temp = temp.next
        return head
```
